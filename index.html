<p>I had to find a soltoin for a modfide BFS search angoritem 
And I know that they are doing a lote of JS for dom manupolation so.
So after the interview I thught I will chalange myself and write that in js </p>

<p>I am not sure that I complitliy remember the question it was kind of long (the intreview was in Chegg) so if some one 
can contrbutue and give more detiles for the question that will be great.
But i do remember the answer here is the mix of the answer and the quetion. </p>

<p>each node has: 
node
  |-&gt;parent
  |-&gt;children[] 
  |-&gt;next_siblean</p>

<p>The main Idea was doing a modfied BFS search but you are are getting a node (anywhere on the tree) and you have to  return the first red node 
first you travel to your children all the way to the leaf and to your brodthers 
then you have to ignore any node that you whould have to use in order to travle to the node that you got in start </p>
